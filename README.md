WIP proof of concept for low-cost static dataframes.

How to build
------------

### Requirements

 * **Compiler**: `clang >= 4` or `gcc >= 7`.
 * **CMake**: `CMake-3.5`. (Older versions may work, but have not been tested.)

### Build

To change the compiler used by CMake and make, define the `CXX` variable prior to running
the cmake command. This is only of interst when building the tests as the Candas library is
header only. E.g. do `CXX=clang++ cmake ..` to configure using the clang C++ compiler.

The change the build type for the tests add `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<...>` to the cmake command.
The valid build types are: `Debug`, `Release`, and `RelWithDebInfo`.

``` bash
# setup
cd path/to/candas
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

# build & run tests
cd path/to/candas/build
make check
# - alternativly
make test-candas
make test  # or execute 'tests/test-candas'
```
